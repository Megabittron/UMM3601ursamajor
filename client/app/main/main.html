        <h2>What is the Undergraduate Research Symposium?</h2>
        <p>
            The URS offers an opportunity for the UMM community to present research, creative work and art performances. The audience not only includes peers, faculty and family,
            but reaches far beyond the campus community. The URS continually manages to show the world what the UMM community can achieve.

        <h2>Why URSA Major?</h2>
        <p>
            When CSci 3601's students were given the task of making an application for the Undergraduate Research Symposium, they were also given the tough job of deciding
            what the application's design would be like, choosing what it would be named, and designing its capabilities. The goal of URSA Major is
            to be an organizational web application that streamlines the reviewing process, and automates whenever possible, in order to fluidly integrate all aspects of the URS, from submissions,
            to reviews, to the organizing of the entire event.
